- Auto Claim Charters with Kakera

How does it work:
The tool basically captures characters over the kakera value you set in the config by reacting to it.
It also works with wishes aswell.

Requirements:
- Chrome driver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
- Chromium: https://download-chromium.appspot.com/
- Python 3 (I recommend using Miniconda to setup virtual environments but its up to your preferences)

Installation:
1.	Cd into directory of folder using your terminal.
2.	Run the command => [ pip install -r requirements.txt ].

Setup and Usage:
- Make sure enter the values for the config if you any help you can put your question it in the issues tab.
- After you finished the installation process run the command => [ python sniper.py ].
- Lastly enjoy sniping and getting good chracters
